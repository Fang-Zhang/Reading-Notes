# Part 1: The E-Myth and American Small Business
## Chapter 1. The Entrepreneurial Myth
- **E-Myth**: The myth of Entrepreneurial. People think small business are started by entrepreneurial, in fact, most are not.
- **Entrepreneurial Seizure**: Once you were stricken with an Entrepreneurial Seizure, there was no relief. You couldn't get rid of it. You have to start your own business.
- **Fatal Assumption**: If you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work. You would be forced to learn how to make the business work, rather than to do the work yourself.
## Chapter 2. The Entrepreneurial, the Manager and the Technician
- **Entrepreneur**: The entrepreneur personality turns the most trivial condition into an exceptional opportunity. He lives in the future.
- **Manager**: The Manager personality is pragmatic. Without the Manager, there would be no planning, no order, no predictability. He lives in the past.
- **Technician**: The technician is the doer. "If you want it done right, do it yourself" is the technician's credo. He live in the present.

While Entrepreneurial dreams, the Manager frets, and the Technician ruminates.
