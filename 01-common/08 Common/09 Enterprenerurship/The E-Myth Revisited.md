# Part 1: The E-Myth and American Small Business
## Chapter 1. The Entrepreneurial Myth
- **E-Myth**: The myth of Entrepreneurial. People think small business are started by entrepreneurial, in fact, most are not.
- **Entrepreneurial Seizure**: Once you were stricken with an Entrepreneurial Seizure, there was no relief. You couldn't get rid of it. You have to start your own business.
- **Fatal Assumption**: If you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work. You would be forced to learn how to make the business work, rather than to do the work yourself.
## Chapter 2. The Entrepreneurial, the Manager and the Technician
- **Entrepreneur**: The entrepreneur personality turns the most trivial condition into an exceptional opportunity. He lives in the future.
- **Manager**: The Manager personality is pragmatic. Without the Manager, there would be no planning, no order, no predictability. He lives in the past.
- **Technician**: The technician is the doer. "If you want it done right, do it yourself" is the technician's credo. He live in the present.
<br />

While Entrepreneurial dreams, the Manager frets, and the Technician ruminates.

## Chapter 3. Infancy: The Technician's Phase
Three phases of a business's growth: Infancy -> Adolescence -> Maturity
<br />

It's easy to spot a business in **Infancy** ---the owner and the business are one adn the same thing.
<br />

In infancy, you are the business.
<br />

Infancy ends when the owner realizes that the business can't continue to run the way it has been before. In order to survive, it will have to change.
<br />

The purpose of going into business is to expand beyond your existing horizons. So you can invent something that satisfies a need in the marketplace that has never been satisfied before. So you can live an expanded, stimulating new life.
<br />

## Chapter 4. Adolescence: Getting some Help
- Adolescence begins at the point in the life of your business when you decide to get some help --- technical help from someone with experience in your kind of business.
- Someone who knows how to do the technical work that isn't getting done --- usually the work you don't like to do.
## Chapter 5. Beyond the comfort zone
- **Getting Small Again**: You don't own a business --- you own a job.
- **Going for Broke**: "Going-for-broke" businesses are a sign of our time. 
- **Adolescent Survival**: Simply put, your job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth.
## Chapter 6. Maturity and the Entrepreneurial Perspective
- **Entrepreneurial Perspective**: How it looks, how it acts, how it does what it is intended to do.
- **Entrepreneurial Model**: This model has less to do with what's done in a business and more to do with how it's done. The commodity isn't what's important --- the way it's delivered is.
# Part 2: The Turn-Key Revolution: A New View of Business
## Chapter 7. The Turn-Key Revolution
- **Franchise Phenomenon**: MacDonald's
- **The Most successful Small Business in the World**: Compare that statistic to the more than 80-percent failure rate of independently owned business, and you can immediately understand the power of the Turn-Key Revolution in our economy, and the contribution that the Business Format Franchise has made to it and future success of your business.
- **Turning the Key: The Business Format Franchise**: Business Format Franchise moves a step beyond the trade name franchise. It not only lends its name to the smaller enterprise but it also provides the franchisee with an entire system of doing business.
- **Selling the Business Instead of the Product**:
## Chapter 8. The Franchise Prototype
- **Training program**: Hamburger U
## Chapter 9. Working on your business, Not in it.
- **Your business is not your life**: Once you recognize that the purpose of your life is not to serve your business, but that the primary purpose of your business is to serve your life, you can go to work on your business, rather than in it, with full understanding of why it is absolutely necessary for you to do so.
- The model will provide consistent value to your customers, employees, suppliers, and lenders, beyond what they expect.
- The model will be operated by people with the lowest possible level of skill.
- The model will stand out as as a place of impeccable order.
- All work in the model will be documented in Operations Manuals.
- The model will provide a  uniformly predictable service to the customer.
- The model will utilize a uniform color, dress and facilities code.
