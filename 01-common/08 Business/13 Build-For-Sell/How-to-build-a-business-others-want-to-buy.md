1. Why every 15-year-old boy needs a Karen Pini in his life (hat does 5-star experience look like?)

2. Why most small businesses fail (If you fell ill and counldn't work, how long could your business survive?) 
- technician -> manager -> owner
- delivering service/produce -> building business others want to buy
- The technician(does the bulk of the work that brings in the revenue)
  - make and sell the product or service
  - design the systems and processes
  - write the sales copy
  - send the invoices and do the administration
- The manager(manages the people who do the work)
  - turn the entrepreneur's vision into reality(action)
  - directly manage tasks, projects or people
  - keep the team accountable to the KPIs
  - build the team, create the systems and provide structure and support
- The owner(dreamer, visionary, the 'big picture' thinker)
  - create a compelling vision and motivate the team to bring to life
  - think of new way to do things
  - build partnerships and collaborations

  - Do you understand what every task and obligation means?
  - Do you fully understand the role this job plays in the wider functioning of the business?
  - Do you have the skills and experience to deliver on the job at hand?
- Do you want it? (Assuming cadidate say "yes" to all the above questions, then ask the following)
  - Now that you know exactly what the role entails, do you honestly, genuinely, with no reservations want this job?
  - Is there another job that you had your eye on (but didn't get), making this role the booby prize?
  - Are you interested in this role because you've got your eye on the prize of a bigger job a few rungs above this one?
  - Do you see yourself staying in this same role for at least three years?
- Do you have the capacity to fit this job into your life?
  - Do you have the time, mental preparedness, skills, experience, desire and space to fully commit to this role?
  - Is there anything going on in your life that would prevent you from completing this job to the standards I have outlined in the earlier questions?
  - Is there anything that could prevent you from completing this job in the allocated time?
