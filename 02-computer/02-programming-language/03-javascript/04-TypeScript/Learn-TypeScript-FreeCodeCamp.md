## Learnnig Approach
1. Vedio -> Official Doc
2. Coding can make understanding clearly

## Basics
1. Type
   - string
   - number (not int, float, or numbers)
   - boolean

## TypeScript Best Practice
1. Don't put the annotation too explicitly. (such as: let mynum: number = 3.14)
2. Don't use "any" tpye anywhere. Basically, "any" means trun off the type-checking function for variable. Using compiler flag "noImplicitAny" to flag any implicit "any" as an error.
